## How to install Theme Color Tool


### Install with the Contribution Manager

Add contributed tools by selecting the menu item _Tools_ â†’ _Add Tool..._ This will open the Contribution Manager, where you can browse for Theme Color Tool, or any other tool you want to install.

Not all available tools have been converted to show up in this menu. If a tool isn't there, it will need to be installed manually by following the instructions below.

### Manual Install

Contributed tools may be downloaded separately and manually placed within the `tools` folder of your Processing sketchbook. To find (and change) the Processing sketchbook location on your computer, open the Preferences window from the Processing application (PDE) and look for the "Sketchbook location" item at the top.

By default the following locations are used for your sketchbook folder: 
  * For Mac users, the sketchbook folder is typically located inside `~/Documents/Processing` but may has other location.
  * For Windows users, the sketchbook folder is typically located inside `My Documents/Processing` but may has other location.

Unzip and copy the contributed tool's folder into the `tools` folder in the Processing sketchbook. You will need to create this `tools` folder if it does not exist.
    
The folder structure for tool Theme Color Tool should be as follows:

```
Processing
  tools
    Theme Color Tool
      templates
      tool
        Theme Color Tool.jar
```
                      
After tool Theme Color Tool has been successfully installed, restart the Processing application.
